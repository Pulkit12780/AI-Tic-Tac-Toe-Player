# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe-Player
Implemented an AI agent to play Tic Tac Toe using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning. Explored turn-based decision logic, game trees, and optimal move strategies. This project deepened understanding of adversarial search, constraint satisfaction, and planning under uncertainty â€” core elements of interactive AI applications.
